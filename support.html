<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p><strong>How does SwimAlyzer work?</strong><br>
SwimAlyzer uses AI-powered pose detection to analyze your swimming technique from video. Record or import a side-view video of your freestyle swimming, trim a 12-second clip, and the app provides technique scores (0–400) across six metrics: Entry Angle, Recovery Height, Body Alignment, Head Position, Kick, and Symmetry.</p>

<p><strong>What camera angle works best?</strong><br>
A side view (perpendicular to the swimmer) works best. Position the camera at pool deck level or slightly elevated. Make sure the full stroke cycle is visible in the frame.</p>

<p><strong>Is my data private?</strong><br>
Yes. All video and analysis data stays on your device. We do not upload or store your videos on any server. See our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

<p><strong>How do I restore my subscription?</strong><br>
Open SwimAlyzer → Settings → tap "Restore Purchases". Your subscription is linked to your Apple ID and will be restored automatically.</p>

<p><strong>How do I cancel my subscription?</strong><br>
Subscriptions are managed through Apple. Go to Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions → SwimAlyzer → Cancel. You retain access until the end of your current billing period.</p>

<p><strong>The analysis seems inaccurate. What can I do?</strong><br>
Ensure good video quality: stable camera, clear side view, good lighting, and the swimmer fully visible in the frame. Avoid underwater or angled shots. A 12-second clip with 2–3 full stroke cycles gives the best results.</p>
